Optional components and those that need pre-processing, such as SASS files, are collected here from GDSâ€™s design system [1]_.

You can use grunt/gulp/webpack or another workflow to build these files.
If ``libsass`` or the ``[scss]`` extra was installed, a base CSS file is built from defaults in ``stylesheets/base.scss``.
