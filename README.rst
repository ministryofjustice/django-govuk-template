Django GOV.UK Template
======================

It should be easy to make a Django-based service that follows Government Digital Services’ style guide and reference materials.
But https://pypi.python.org/pypi/govuk-template is not kept updated and is not readily usable in Django and
https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template cannot be installed directly into a Django project without complex build steps.

This package takes components published by GDS and creates an app in a Django project which can then be used as normal.
This process downloads a release from https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template and the contents of Node.js packages
https://www.npmjs.com/package/govuk-elements-sass and https://www.npmjs.com/package/govuk_frontend_toolkit

Usage
-----

- Setup a Django project using ``manage.py startproject`` or other means
- Install ``django-govuk-template`` and add ``govuk_template_base`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``
- Call ``manage.py startgovukapp [[app name, e.g. govuk_template]]``
    - Add this app to ``INSTALLED_APPS``
    - Ensure that this app is included in source control as the intention is that it’s only rebuilt as needed
    - If an update is needed in the future, delete the app created in previous step and run this command again
- Add ``govuk_template_base.context_processors.govuk_template_base`` to the template context processors
- Use ``[[app name, e.g. govuk_template]].html`` as the template to extend from and overrive the ``inner_content`` block

See the demo folder in this repository on `GitHub`_, it is not included in distributions.

Additionally, add ``django-govuk-forms`` to your project to output Django forms styled using GOV.UK elements.
You can install this package automatically by adding ``django-govuk-template[forms]`` to your requirements file.

NB: Until version 1.0, there is likely going to be a lot of variation in the api, so it’s a good idea to pin a specific version.

Development
-----------

.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/ministryofjustice/django-govuk-template.svg?branch=master
    :target: https://travis-ci.org/ministryofjustice/django-govuk-template

Please report bugs and open pull requests on `GitHub`_.

Use ``python setup.py test`` to run all tests.

This repository does not need to be updated for every release of GDS’s packages, only breaking changes for overridden components may need fixes.

If any localisable strings change, run ``python setup.py makemessages compilemessages``.

Distribute a new version to `PyPi`_ by updating the ``VERSION`` tuple in ``govuk_template_base`` and run ``python setup.py compilemessages sdist bdist_wheel upload``.

To do
-----

- Add browser-sync for easier local development
- Add javascript building options
- Add additional GOV.UK patterns
- Improve ``ServiceSettings`` model
- Perhaps improve SCSS building mechanism (e.g. command line fallback) and print styles
- Perhaps improve app naming or documentation regarding ``govuk_template_base`` and ``govuk_template``
- It would be nice to require as few external tools as possible (e.g. docker/node/ruby) to make building simpler
