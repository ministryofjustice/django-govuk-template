NAME?
=====

Things to name:
- this package: can't be template/govuk-template
    - a django app (likely of same name) and needs to be included in INSTALLED_APPS of project
    - makes a django app (project owner decides) in project by downloading and compiling gov.uk toolkits

Motivation
----------

It should be easy to make a Django-based service that follows Government Digital Servicesâ€™ style guide and reference materials.
It would be nice to not need many external tools installed to build static assets.

- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/govuk-template is not kept up to date
- https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template cannot be installed directly into a Django project without complex build steps
- hence download Django release from https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template/releases and build custom app in the target Django project
- this repo does not need to be updated for every release, only breaking changes for overridden components

-

Usage
-----

Install using ``pip install govuk-django-template``. Sample usage:

.. code-block:: python

    ???
