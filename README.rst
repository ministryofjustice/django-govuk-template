Django GOV.UK Template
======================

It should be easy to make a Django-based service that follows Government Digital Services’ style guide and reference materials.
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/govuk-template is not kept updated and is not readily usable in Django.
https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template cannot be installed directly into a Django project without complex build steps.

This package takes pieces published by GDS and creates an app in a Django project which can then be used as normal.
This process downloads a release from https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template

Usage
-----

- Setup a Django project using ``manage.py startproject`` or other means
- Install ``django-govuk-template`` and add ``govuk_template_base`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``
- Call ``manage.py startgovukapp [[app name, e.g. govuk_template]]``
    - Add this app to ``INSTALLED_APPS``
    - Ensure that this app is included in source control as the intention is that it’s only rebuilt as needed
    - If an update is needed in the future, delete the app created in previous step and run this command again
- Add ``govuk_template_base.context_processors.govuk_template_base`` to the template context processors

See the demo folder in this repository on `GitHub`_, it is not included in distributions.

Additionally, add ``django-govuk-forms`` to your project to output Django forms styled using GOV.UK elements.
You can install this package automatically by adding ``django-govuk-template[forms]`` to your requirements file.

Development
-----------

Please report bugs and open pull requests on `GitHub`_.

Use ``python setup.py test`` to run all tests.

This repository does not need to be updated for every release of GDS’s packages, only breaking changes for overridden components may need fixes.

Distribute a new version by updating the ``VERSION`` tuple in ``govuk_template_base`` and run ``python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload``.

To do
-----

- It would be nice to require as few external tools as possible (e.g. docker/node/ruby) to make building simpler
- Should the template be created in the root or in under generated app name (as now)?
- Should CSS generated (currently base.css) from GOV.UK elements be named differently?
- Add browser-sync / watchdog components for easier local development using testserver
